**NOTE**: These solutions refer to an older version of the _Think Python_ book
that used Python 2.7. Therefore you will encounter some differences between
your code and this code. However, it can still be a help to get a hint on how
to proceed, and you anyways shouldn't copy-paste any code but think through
it yourself. :)


**TIP**: Push your own solutions up to GitHub and maybe it'll become a repository
that other learners will refer to when working through the Python 3 version
of the _Think Python_ book!
